<I>The scene is a draughty old railway waiting room at a small English village.<P> The next train is due at 21.45. The stranger sits alone, quietly humming to himself.</I><p>

<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> hmmmm mmmmm hmmmm hmmm<p>

 <I>(After a few moments a creaky door opens and Alan and Betty enter the waiting room)</i><p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Brrrr it is cold out there tonight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I am chilled to the marrow.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Good job you wore your new warm coat.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> It certainly is. Let's sit down then. We have about 10 minutes before the train arrives.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I think it may be delayed tonight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh, good evening sir, why do you say that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger: </font color="#0000FF">You know, sometimes we just get a feeling about something.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, that's true enough, but I hope it isn't too late<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Are you travelling through to Norwich?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes. It will be Norwich for me today.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> We are going there too.<p>
<I>(The creaky door opens once more as Tom enters)</I><p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello Tom, how are you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Very cold I can say that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Freezing out there tonight isn't it Tom?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, and not much warmer in here. Too many draughts.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> It's a very old building.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Very true, been here all my life.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> It would be nice if they would build a new one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Not much chance of that. This line will probably be closed down before too long.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Unfortunately, very true. Not many of these remote branch lines are left now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> I haven't seen you here before sir. Have you just moved to this area?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> No, I don't live around these parts, just passing through.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan: </font color="#0000FF">Not often we see a strange face here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Hardly ever.<p>

<I>( The creaky door opens once again and the wind is blowing as Jennifer enters the waiting room.)</I><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Hello Jenny, nice to see you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello everyone. My goodness it is blowing so hard out there now and I thought I may have missed the train.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty;</font color="#0000FF"> No you haven't missed it, come and sit over here out of the draught<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Thanks Betty<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger: </font color="#0000FF">The tain will be late today.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">Well,  maybe, mostly it is on time though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Not tonight though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Alan</font color="#0000FF">: You seem very sure of that. Do you work for the railway?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Ha! No, I have never worked for the rail company.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, I just wondered.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I hope the train is warm.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty.</font color="#0000FF"> So do I.<p>


<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I had to run nearly all the way here, not easy in these heels.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> You always leave things to the last minute.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I know, I should be better organised. Yesterday I left a note out for the milkman asking for an extra pint.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> That doesn't seem disorganised.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer: </font color="#0000FF">It is really. You see, I don't have milk delivered<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Jennifer you are so silly sometimes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Another five minutes for the train<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Could be longer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Perhaps.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom.</font color="#0000FF"> Tell me sir, what brings you to Owlpen?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Just wandering through.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">I see. Do you do that a lot? Wander?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I do it all the time<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Interesting.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I find it so.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I must say I wouldn't want  to wander far in these heels.<p>
<I> (Jennifer and Betty laugh at this)</I><p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I am sure I would also find that difficult.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you work or just wander? Excuse my inquisitiveness<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't mind people being inquisitive, in fact, I rather enjoy it. And to answer your question, I do work but it is rather strange work.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Now that sounds interesting. Strange in what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmm, at this point of a conversation I am often tempted to say 'Between you and me' or 'Don't let this go any further' or even 'never tell this to anyone else' but really  there is no need.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Now I am sure you have us all very puzzled.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I can understand why it may seem puzzling but in fact it is quite simple<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> If so simple then tell us, what do you do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I think he is a spy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> (laughs) No, no, no. Not a spy. Firstly though, let me tell you why I don't have to ask you to be secretive about it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">yes that would be a good start.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I am no good at keeping secrets anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Nor me (Jenny and Betty laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> I could take a secret to the grave but in this case, it doesn't seem necessary.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger: </font color="#0000FF">Quite. And the reason you do not need to be secretive is that if you told anyone they would not believe you anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Now it is getting very curious.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> In fact, I am almost certain that none of you will believe what I say.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> I like to keep an open mind.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> As we all should.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> So are we to know what it is? This thing that you feel we will not believe.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger.</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, yes, I am sorry for delaying it. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> we still have a few minutes before the train arrives.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> It will be late anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> As you have said.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I would say I have a role rather than a job or occupation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Ooooh are you an actor then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Not an actor. Although to be frank, I suppose it does require a certain amount of acting.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> But not on the stage?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> No<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Or in the movies?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> No, I would rather hope I am not in the entertainment business, although sometimes I wonder?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">So put us out of our misery, what is this errr.. role?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I am king Charles<p>
<I>(Everyone but the stranger laughs)</I><p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok you had us all fooled there for a moment. I thought you were really going to tell us what you do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you mean prince charles?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> It is king Charles now Jennifer, don't you remember<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes of course. Sorry your majesty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Jennifer, you don't have to call him your majesty. He isn't really King Charles. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Ah but I am, and as I said. You don't believe me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> I hate to sound unkind but how can you possibly be King Charles. I mean, we all know what King Charles looks like and you look nothing like him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I have only seen him on the telly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I am afraid you are wrong there my friend. Until this evening you had no idea what King Charles looks like.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> I beg to differ there. I am sure we all know what he looks like.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger: </font color="#0000FF">The man you know as King Charles is in fact not King Charles, I am. He is somebody that people are led to believe is King Charles.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Why would that be? I am always ready to give the benefit of the doubt but this really does seem a bit far fetched.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> But harmless<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Harmless?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, if you want to believe you are King Charles I am sure it hurts nobody else<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer: </font color="#0000FF">Unless the real King Charles finds out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger</font color="#0000FF"> (With a little chuckle) But of course. I am the real one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> So what about Camilla?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> What about her?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, is she the real Camilla?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> She is real but her name is not Camilla, it is Phylis.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> And the person we know as King Charles. What is his name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Nigel, since 2019 anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Tom: </font color="#0000FF">You mean he changed his name? This, Hmm, I suppose you would call an actor, changed his name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> No. Not at all. He is not the same person as pre 2019<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Not the same person?<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">The Stranger. </font color="#0000FF">No, they change them around every few years. They get bored with the job very easily pretending to be somebody else.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> A bit like the actors in tv soaps<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> A bit like that yes.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> The train is late.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger: </font color="#0000FF">I thought it would be.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> So what I am thinking is why? I mean, if we believed that you are King Charles. Why is there someone playing your part?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> It all started in the summer of 1840 with the attempted assassination of Queen Victoria, my great, great, great grandmother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer: </font color="#0000FF">Wow! a long time ago.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes indeed. After that it was decided the royal family would stay well away from the public and be impersonated by, what I suppose, are actors.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan; </font color="#0000FF">This is a great story but really hardly believable at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> As I told you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> I can actually believe that may happen, Many things are kept secret from the public.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, that is true enough.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> However sir. I am 100% totally convinced that you are not King Charles.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> That is your prerogative of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> But you tell the story very well.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I appreciate that, thank you. Maybe I tell it well because it is a true story.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">And maybe not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> As you wish.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not sure whether to believe it or not. I am so indecisive.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF"> Have you always been like that then Jen?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not sure.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan.</font color="#0000FF"> I must say I don't believe it either but I wish you well sir and it was nice to meet you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> One more thing I would like to ask, if you wouldn't mind. If we did believe you are the real king Charles, what are you doing here?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Everybody has to be somewhere.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmmm, You did your research well.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> My research?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, that line you just spoke. It was a line from an episode of a radio show called the goons. It was one of the then Prince Charles's favourite shows.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger.</font color="#0000FF"> Yes. It was. I loved that show and was so sad that I could not meet the cast, only my impersonator could do that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I can imagine that would have been very frustrating for the real Prince Charles.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Which I was of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Shhhh, I think I hear the train. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I do too, it's coming, and only a few minutes late.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> Please excuse me ladies and gentlemen. I want to make my way to the end of the platform, I prefer to sit at the back of the train. A very good evening to you all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jennifer:</font color="#0000FF"> Goodbye your Majesty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Nice to meet you sir, enjoy your onward journey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger.</font color="#0000FF"> Thank you, I will.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> a most interesting conversation my friend, more interesting than you can imagine.<p>

<font color="#0000FF">The Stranger:</font color="#0000FF"> I am pleased I kept you amused. Once again, good day to you all, <p>
<I>(The creaky door opens as he leaves)</I><p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Come on Jen, I will help you along the platform in those heels.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer</font color="#0000FF">. Aw thanks Betty, lets make a move<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Bye you two.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jennifer and Betty Together:</font color="#0000FF"> Bye Tom<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> What an interesting old fellow, living in his little dream world.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> He is an imposter of course but much of what he said is true?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Really? Surely not. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes, much of it in fact<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> I find that difficult to believe, surely it was all just fantasy, in his mind?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Not at all. As a matter of fact I know for certain that a lot of what he said was true, I just don't know how he knew about it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alan:</font color="#0000FF"> Well if you know most of it was true,how do you know about it<p>.
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Quite simple really Alan. I don't mean to shock you. But actually. I am the real King Charles.<p>
